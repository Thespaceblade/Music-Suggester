#Music Suggester

Project Overview

Music Suggester is a sentiment-based music recommendation system that suggests songs based on a user’s mood. It analyzes text input, detects the emotional tone, and fetches relevant songs from a dataset or Spotify’s API.

Features

Sentiment Analysis: Detects emotions from user input (Happy, Sad, Relaxed, Motivated).
Song Recommendation: Matches moods with appropriate songs.
Spotify API Integration: Dynamically fetches songs from Spotify.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Uses Tkinter for an interactive experience.
🛠️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
 git clone https://github.com/Thespaceblade/Music-Suggester.git
 cd Music-Suggester
2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Set Up Spotify API Credentials
Create a .env file in the root folder and add:
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
⚠️ Never expose your API credentials in public repositories! Use .gitignore to exclude the .env file.
5️⃣ Run the Application
python Music_Suggester.py

🎨 How It Works
User Input: Enter a phrase describing your mood.
Sentiment Analysis: The script classifies the mood.
Song Matching:
If a local dataset is used, it finds a song that matches the sentiment.
If Spotify API is enabled, it fetches new songs dynamically.
Recommendation: The selected song is displayed.
